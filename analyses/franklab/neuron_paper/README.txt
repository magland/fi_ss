Tetrode dataset
	Run mountainsort
		> kron-run ms2mn tetrode
		> kron-view results ms2mn tetrode
	Retrieve manual sortings
		> kron-run manual1 tetrode
		> kron-run manual2 tetrode
		> kron-run manual3 tetrode
	Compare results:
		e.g., > kron-view compare_results manual1,ms2mn tetrode


Probe dataset
	Run mountainsort
		> kron-run ms2mn probe

Neto-Kampff ground truth dataset
	Run mountainsort
		> kron-run ms2mn nk1_ch101-128
	Retrieve juxta (ground truth) extracted using ahb's script
		> kron-run juxta nk1_ch101-128
	Compare them:
		> kron-view compare_results juxta,ms2mn nk1_ch101-128
	The above can be repeated using the full 128 channels by replacing "nk1_ch101-128" by "nk1"
	Run kilosort
		> kron-run ks256 nk1
	Run spyking circus
		Make sure that spyking-circus is installed properly and in your path
		You may need to restart the processing daemon if there are path issues
		> kron-run sc nk1
	Pull up the static results (and export the confusion matrices)
		> kron-run juxta nk1
		> kron-run results_ms2mn nk1
		> kron-run results_ks256 nk1
		> kron-run results_sc nk1
		> kron-view compare_results juxta,results_ms2mn nk1
		> kron-view compare_results juxta,results_ks256 nk1
		> kron-view compare_results juxta,results_sc nk1
